            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Gayatri a web developer with a passion for creating visually appealing and functional websites.I graduated from Amrita University,Coimbatore in 2022 with a degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering. My interests are in Front End Engineering and I love to create beautiful performant products with delightful user experiences.I previously worked at Grab where I led the Grab for Work project. Grab for Work was a service for companies to make corporate transportation expenses convenient. Companies can create employee groups, set ride policies and share corporate payment methods with their employees. I built the project with another engineer over the period of 3 months on a React/Redux and Golang stack."I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role at Lyft because I like working in this ridesharing space and creating products to improve the lives of users.

                <p>It is a project that is dealing with  organ donation and transplantation.Take a minute to help those in need. Sign up as an organ, eye, and tissue donor. Every registration counts. Sign up.On March 22, 2023, HRSA launched the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Modernization Initiative to better serve the needs of patients and families. The Initiative will strengthen accountability, equity, and performance of the organ donation and transplantation system through a focus on five key areas: technology; data transparency; governance; operations; and quality improvement and innovation. As a first step in the Modernization Initiative, HRSA launched a new dashboard and Public Use File (PUF) to enhance transparency in the national organ donation, procurement, and transplantation system. View the dashboard and accompanying PUF for demographic information about organ donors, waitlist candidates/registrants, and transplant recipients, as well as organ-specific data such as procured organ transplantation rates and transplant outcomes for several solid organ types. </p>
